## Project Proposal Instructions (PLEASE READ BEFORE SUBMITTING ANYTHING)

Thank you for your interest in the KnightHacks projects program. We want to give everyone the opportunity to pitch their project ideas before any teams are established.

This repository will serve as the central location of all proposals submitted by other interested members.

Leading up to the interest meeting for this program (yet to be determined when and where), anyone can submit their proposed idea to this repository **as an issue** using the proposal issue template. After submitting, the directors and other interested parties may comment on your proposal to suggest new ideas or help strengthen your proposal. Once submitted, that project proposal is under your ownership, other proposals that are deemed as too similar will be closed.

You will have the opportunity to present your proposal, if you so choose, at the interest meeting to pitch your idea to attendees interested in joining a team. If you don't have a proposal to pitch or don't feel comfortable speaking to an audience, don't worry! Nobody is required to present their idea at the meeting, and your idea will still be available for anyone who attends to show their interest in.

Following the interest meeting, attendees will have a week or two to submit a formal interest form online where they can rank their favorite projects in the order of which they would like to be a part of. The directors will do their best to form teams based on these rankings so that everyone can work with similarly passionate individuals on a project everyone wants to develop!

If you were the author of a proposal around which a team is formed, you will automatically be assigned the role of "Team Lead" for the purposes of organization and communication. However, the exact responsibilities and group dynamics will be left up to the discretion of your full group.

Here's the general template we've provided for you to submit your proposal with under the issues tab.

### Full Name: Required

### Knights Email: Required

### Will you be presenting: Yes or No

### What's your idea about?

Here's where you talk about your idea with as many details as you have. Once submitted, you may get new suggestions from interested parties you may want to incorporate, and please feel free to do so!

Here are some topics to cover:

- What is the main purpose of your project?
- What is the problem you are trying to solve, if there is one (there doesn't have to be!)?
- What group of people is this project targeted for?
- What platform do you want to develop this project for?
- What are some of the important features of this project?
  - How do these features impact user experience?
- How are you planning to tackle some of these features or any potential challenges you forsee?
- What language(s) and/or technologies do you think you would want to use on this project (if you don't have anything specific, don't answer this)?

There's no strict length for your proposal and, in many cases, the more detailed your proposal is the better. Our recommendation would be at least two paragraphs worth of information, but there's no expected structure. Try to keep it less than 500-600 words so you don't lose anyone's attention, but you may need any amount less than that. At the interest meeting, you will probably not have much longer than a few minutes to present your proposal, so include here all the information you want interested parties to know and may not be able to get to in your pitch. That way, anyone can reference your proposal on this repository as they are making their decisions.

### Last note: We're including an example proposal in this repository so that you can get a feel for the kind of information we suggest you include in your proposal, but there is no expected structure. Good luck!
