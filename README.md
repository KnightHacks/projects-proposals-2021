## Project Proposal Instructions (PLEASE READ BEFORE SUBMITTING ANYTHING)

Thank you for your interest in the KnightHacks projects program. We want to give everyone the opportunity to pitch their project ideas before any teams are established. This repository will serve as the central location of all proposals submitted by other interested members.

Leading up to the interest meeting for this program (yet to be determined when and where), anyone can submit their proposed idea to this repository as an issue using the proposal issue template. After submitting, the directors and other interested parties may comment on your proposal to suggest new ideas or help strengthen your idea. Once submitted, that project proposals is under your ownership, other proposals that are deemed as too similar will be closed.

You will have the opportunity to present your proposal, if you so choose, at the interest meeting to pitch your idea to attendees interested in joining a team. If you don't have a proposal to pitch or don't feel comfortable speaking to an audience, don't worry! Nobody is required to present their ideas at the meeting, and your idea will still be available for anyone who attends to show their interest in.

Following the interest meeting, attendees will have a week or two to submit a formal interest form online where they can rank their favorite projects in the order of which they would like to be a part of. The directors will do their best to form teams based on these rankings so that everyone can work with similarly passionate individuals! If you were author of a proposal around which a team is formed, you will automatically be assigned the role of "Team Lead" for the purposes of organization and communication, although work dynamics will be left up to the members to decide.

Good luck, and thank you for your ideas!
