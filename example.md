## What's your idea about?

I want to make a mobile app that will allow a group of people to play anything with a deck of cards between all their phones. A group of phones can be connected to a single simulated deck. One phone is designated to hold the deck, the face-up pile, and the discard pile, all the other phones hold an individual's hand of cards. Each player can interact with one of the three piles in the central phone, either drawing a new card, flipping over the top card to the face-up pile, moving a card from your hand to the face up pile, or discarding a card from your hand. There will be buttons on each player's phone that perform these actions, the central phone is only a display that updates when an action is performed.

The goal is to allow groups of people to play cards on the spot without the need to have a deck on you at all times. Everyone can download this free app and connect to a single game, provided it hasn't been started, with a group name. The creator can choose to admit players attempting to join the group by name. The owner will be the central phone with the deck.
